# safe_driving_application
An app that discourages texting while driving. Uses Google Maps API.

Scenario:
You're driving to Randy's house. He's excited and constantly texts you "When will you be here?" and "Are you almost here?"
Maybe you feel like you need to respond "Be there in five minutes, Randy."
Sero will automatically send Randy a message that you'll be there in five minutes. 

First, put in Randy's phone number and address. 
Next, start driving. 
Sero will use Google Maps API to know when you're close to Randy's house. 
No need to text and drive, now!

## Here's the home page that shows the Google Maps API:
